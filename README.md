# GoHike is an app for hikers, walkers and maybe runners.
Current version is generally working. The map displays the 2D and 3D views. And also displays the standard, hybrid and salellite views. The speed bar allows the user to quickly visulize his/her walking speed. The Distance-bar displays your total walking distance. The weather display uses the weather api (openWeatherMap.org) to display the current weather. The GOHike app also allows you to plot your final route. This route display uses both a line plot and pin annotations to show the hike their accomplished waling path. It is desired that this hiking/walking/running app be as pleasent and simple to utilize as possible.
