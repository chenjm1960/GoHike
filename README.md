# GoHike is an app for hikers, walkers and maybe runners Stage one of building this app is to get all the features working.
Features such as map display, information display and lastly, the design look. Currently, the Map display is working.
The map displays the 2D and 3D views. And also displays the standard, hybrid and salellite views. Also, the 'speed bar' has 
also been built and is working. This speed bar allows the user to quickly visulize his/her walking or slow running speed. 
The speed bar uses the app data for speed and plots it out in the progress view; which is updated every 1 sec. 
The weather display uses the weather api (openWeatherMap.org) to display the current weather. Lastly, a working version of
the ability to plot the walking route is working. This tool uss the initial and final user coordinates. It works well for
routes that are more or less linear, but problems arrise for routes that loop back to the starting point or origin.
lastly, the app design will take place to make this app as Apple compliant as possible. 
It is desired that this hiking/walking/running app be as pleasent and simple to utilize as possible.
